# Signet

A client-scoped identity system generator: marks, lockups, and brand kits.

See [`docs/signet-brief.md`](docs/signet-brief.md) for the full spec and
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the pipeline overview.

## Install

```bash
poetry install
poetry run signet --version
poetry run signet doctor
```

## Data setup

Everything under `data/` is user-specific (decks, registry, clients) and
gitignored. Each subdirectory ships a `*.example.*` starter file -- copy it
to the real filename and edit it:

```bash
cp data/decks/identity.example.jsonl data/decks/identity.jsonl
cp data/decks/typefaces.example.jsonl data/decks/typefaces.jsonl
```

## Status

M0 (skeleton) only. See the repo's issue tracker / project board for the
full roadmap.
